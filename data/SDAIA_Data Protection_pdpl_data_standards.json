Introduction DAMA is a non-profit global association, dedicated to advancing the concepts and practices of data management. Established in 1980, DAMA currently has 70 chapters across 33 countries around the world, each with a goal to promote the understanding and practice of managing data as a key asset supporting public and private organizations. To fulfill their mission, DAMA published the International Guide to Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA DMBOK), in addition to certifications, conferences, and trainings. As such, DAMA has been selected as a key reference for the Kingdom’s National Data Management Standards. Moreover, nations around the world are harnessing the value of data as the new oil and unlocking its innovation and economic potential. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia generates, collects, and stores vast amounts of data that has substantial potential to contribute to its economic growth and welfare of its people. To enable the achievement of its data value, the Kingdom has developed the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards to govern and control the practice of data and build an effective data driven organization across government entities. The National Data Management Office (NDMO), as the national regulator of data in the Kingdom, developed the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards based on the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Framework along with the required controls and specifications for implementing and governing effective data management practices across government entities. Through these standards, NDMO also aims to govern data management related efforts and initiatives across entities. 2.1. Overview The National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards document covers Data Management and Personal Data Protection domains. To support the development of the Data Management and Personal Data Protection standards, a set of international references, internal relevant policies and regulations, and guiding principles were defined. Government Entities must implement the standards, and compliance will be measured yearly to monitor progress and drive efforts towards a successful implementation. 3. Purpose and Scope The National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards have been developed pursuant to the directive issued by the Saudi Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence under Cabinet Resolution number (292) dating 27/04/1441H which directs the National Data Management Office to develop and implement policies, governance mechanisms, standards and controls for data and artificial intelligence and monitor compliance upon publication. The standards are defined for 15 domains as per the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Framework and are intended to be adopted by all Public Entities within the Kingdom. In addition to Public Entities, the scope of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards also extends to business partners handling government data. Such business partners are responsible to understand and apply the Data Management and Personal Data Protection standards to all government data assets within their control and custody. The Standards apply to all government data regardless of form or type including paper records, emails, data stored in electronic form, voice recordings, videos, maps, photos, scripts, handwritten documents, or any other form of recorded data. 4. Compliance and Enforcement The compliance assessment aims to measure the implementation of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards by Government Entities based on a defined compliance assessment methodology. Entities will conduct a compliance audit on an annual basis and submit the report to NDMO during the third quarter of each year. NDMO will review and consolidate all entity reports and publish to related stakeholders the annual compliance results at the entity, sector, and whole-of-government level. Entities will conduct the compliance assessment at the level of each specification, with a binary value of either 100% assigned to specifications that are fully implemented, or 0% assigned to specifications that are partially or not implemented. The compliance score of each specification will be cascaded up to the control, domain, and overall Entity level. The annual compliance report shall also be supported with evidence for implementation of each specification where applicable. The compliance exercise shall be led by the Chief Data Officer, supported by the other Data Management and Personal Data Protection Office roles. Based on the outcomes of the submitted Entity Compliance Reports, NDMO may conduct ad-hoc Compliance Audits on selected entities to further review and validate findings. 5. Data Management Guiding Principles The National Data Management Office has defined Data Management Guiding Principles anchoring the development of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards. These principles assist in the understanding of the overall Data Management and Personal Data Protection landscape which map to the 15 domains as stated in the table below.

Introduction DAMA is a non-profit global association, dedicated to advancing the concepts and practices of data management. Established in 1980, DAMA currently has 70 chapters across 33 countries around the world, each with a goal to promote the understanding and practice of managing data as a key asset supporting public and private organizations. To fulfill their mission, DAMA published the International Guide to Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA DMBOK), in addition to certifications, conferences, and trainings. As such, DAMA has been selected as a key reference for the Kingdom’s National Data Management Standards. Moreover, nations around the world are harnessing the value of data as the new oil and unlocking its innovation and economic potential. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia generates, collects, and stores vast amounts of data that has substantial potential to contribute to its economic growth and welfare of its people. To enable the achievement of its data value, the Kingdom has developed the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards to govern and control the practice of data and build an effective data driven organization across government entities. The National Data Management Office (NDMO), as the national regulator of data in the Kingdom, developed the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards based on the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Framework along with the required controls and specifications for implementing and governing effective data management practices across government entities. Through these standards, NDMO also aims to govern data management related efforts and initiatives across entities. 2.1. Overview The National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards document covers Data Management and Personal Data Protection domains. To support the development of the Data Management and Personal Data Protection standards, a set of international references, internal relevant policies and regulations, and guiding principles were defined. Government Entities must implement the standards, and compliance will be measured yearly to monitor progress and drive efforts towards a successful implementation. 3. Purpose and Scope The National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards have been developed pursuant to the directive issued by the Saudi Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence under Cabinet Resolution number (292) dating 27/04/1441H which directs the National Data Management Office to develop and implement policies, governance mechanisms, standards and controls for data and artificial intelligence and monitor compliance upon publication. The standards are defined for 15 domains as per the Data Management and Personal Data Protection Framework and are intended to be adopted by all Public Entities within the Kingdom. In addition to Public Entities, the scope of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards also extends to business partners handling government data. Such business partners are responsible to understand and apply the Data Management and Personal Data Protection standards to all government data assets within their control and custody. The Standards apply to all government data regardless of form or type including paper records, emails, data stored in electronic form, voice recordings, videos, maps, photos, scripts, handwritten documents, or any other form of recorded data. 4. Compliance and Enforcement The compliance assessment aims to measure the implementation of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards by Government Entities based on a defined compliance assessment methodology. Entities will conduct a compliance audit on an annual basis and submit the report to NDMO during the third quarter of each year. NDMO will review and consolidate all entity reports and publish to related stakeholders the annual compliance results at the entity, sector, and whole-of-government level. Entities will conduct the compliance assessment at the level of each specification, with a binary value of either 100% assigned to specifications that are fully implemented, or 0% assigned to specifications that are partially or not implemented. The compliance score of each specification will be cascaded up to the control, domain, and overall Entity level. The annual compliance report shall also be supported with evidence for implementation of each specification where applicable. The compliance exercise shall be led by the Chief Data Officer, supported by the other Data Management and Personal Data Protection Office roles. Based on the outcomes of the submitted Entity Compliance Reports, NDMO may conduct ad-hoc Compliance Audits on selected entities to further review and validate findings. 5. Data Management Guiding Principles The National Data Management Office has defined Data Management Guiding Principles anchoring the development of the National Data Management and Personal Data Protection Standards. These principles assist in the understanding of the overall Data Management and Personal Data Protection landscape which map to the 15 domains as stated in the table below.

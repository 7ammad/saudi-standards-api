Administration 1.1 Scope This Directive provides the minimum requirements for companies and establishments that are subject to the supervision of the High Commission for Industrial Security (HCIS), Ministry of Interior, for security devices used at industrial facilities. 1.2 Application This Directive is applicable to all facilities, including new projects, the expansion of existing facilities, and upgrades. For application to existing facilities, the Owner shall assess his facilities against the requirements of these Directives and coordinate with the General Secretariat of the High Commission for Industrial Security (HCIS) to comply with the Security, Safety, and Fire Protection requirements according to these Directives and add to or modify the existing facilities as required. Where the HCIS has assessed deficiencies in existing facilities during a survey, comparing the current state of the facilities to the requirements of these Directives, those identified deficiencies shall be corrected by the Owner. 1.3 Conflicts & Deviations Where implementation of a requirement is unsuitable or impractical, where other equivalent company or internationally recognized Standards and Codes are followed, or where any conflict exists between this Directive and other company standards and Codes, the deviations shall be resolved by the HCIS. Deviation lower than the requirements of this directive shall be listed and submitted in a report of compliance or non-compliance, with justification and reason, for each applicable requirement of these security directives, and approval shall be received from the HCIS prior to implementation. The documents shall be retained by the company in its permanent engineering files. 2.0. Definitions HCIS High Commission for Industrial Security. The HCIS is part of the Ministry of the Interior. It is responsible for the development, and implementation, of security, safety and fire protection strategies Kingdom-wide. Owner Company or owner of a facility. Shall Indicates a mandatory requirement. Should Indicates a recommendation or that which is advised but not required. ANFO ANFO stands for ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (most often diesel fuel, sometimes kerosene or even molasses). It is by far the most widely used explosive in coal mining, quarrying, metal mining, and civil construction Crash Barriers Anti-Ram Crash Barriers provide a mechanism to prevent forcible ingress of a vehicle into an area. They shall be designed to handle the impact and velocity of a large vehicle and be able to absorb the kinetic energy transferred from the vehicle to the crash barrier during a high speed, forcible ingress attempt. DNT Dinitrotoluene or Dinitro is an explosive which is one of the precursors for trinitrotoluene (TNT), which is synthesized through three separate nitrations of toluene. EGDN Ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), also known as nitroglycol, is a yellowish, oily explosive liquid. Due to its volatility it serves as a detection taggant in some plastic explosives such as semtex. EVD Explosive Vapor Detectors (EVD) provide industrial security departments with the tools to non-intrusively scan vehicles and packages for the presence of explosives. EVD’s draw air into a chamber or they use pads swiped across the object under examination. These items are analyzed for trace presence of molecule’s characteristic of explosives. NG Nitroguanidine is used as an explosive propellant, notably in mixture as the smokeless powder triple-base - the nitroguanidine reduces the propellant's flash and flame temperature. PETN PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate, also known as penthrite) is one of the strongest known high explosives, with a relative effectiveness factor (R.E. factor) of 1.66. RDX Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, also known as RDX, cyclonite, hexogen, and T4, is an explosive nitroamine widely used in military and industrial applications. TNT Trinitrotoluene (TNT) - The explosive yield of TNT is considered the standard measure of strength of bombs and other explosives. X-Ray X-ray systems provide industrial security departments with the tools to non-intrusively scan and monitor the contents of packages and cargo entering areas. X-ray systems use density variations as the basis of analyzing the imagery of the object being scanned. 3.0. References This directive adopts the latest edition of the references listed.

It is responsible for the development, and implementation, of security, safety and fire protection strategies Kingdom-wide. Owner Company or owner of a facility. Shall Indicates a mandatory requirement. Should Indicates a recommendation or that which is advised but not required. ANFO ANFO stands for ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (most often diesel fuel, sometimes kerosene or even molasses). It is by far the most widely used explosive in coal mining, quarrying, metal mining, and civil construction Crash Barriers Anti-Ram Crash Barriers provide a mechanism to prevent forcible ingress of a vehicle into an area. They shall be designed to handle the impact and velocity of a large vehicle and be able to absorb the kinetic energy transferred from the vehicle to the crash barrier during a high speed, forcible ingress attempt. DNT Dinitrotoluene or Dinitro is an explosive which is one of the precursors for trinitrotoluene (TNT), which is synthesized through three separate nitrations of toluene. EGDN Ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), also known as nitroglycol, is a yellowish, oily explosive liquid. Due to its volatility it serves as a detection taggant in some plastic explosives such as semtex. EVD Explosive Vapor Detectors (EVD) provide industrial security departments with the tools to non-intrusively scan vehicles and packages for the presence of explosives. EVD’s draw air into a chamber or they use pads swiped across the object under examination. These items are analyzed for trace presence of molecule’s characteristic of explosives. NG Nitroguanidine is used as an explosive propellant, notably in mixture as the smokeless powder triple-base - the nitroguanidine reduces the propellant's flash and flame temperature. PETN PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate, also known as penthrite) is one of the strongest known high explosives, with a relative effectiveness factor (R.E. factor) of 1.66. RDX Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, also known as RDX, cyclonite, hexogen, and T4, is an explosive nitroamine widely used in military and industrial applications. TNT Trinitrotoluene (TNT) - The explosive yield of TNT is considered the standard measure of strength of bombs and other explosives. X-Ray X-ray systems provide industrial security departments with the tools to non-intrusively scan and monitor the contents of packages and cargo entering areas. X-ray systems use density variations as the basis of analyzing the imagery of the object being scanned. 3.0. References This directive adopts the latest edition of the references listed.

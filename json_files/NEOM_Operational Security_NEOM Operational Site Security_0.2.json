SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security GENERAL 1.0 PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to clearly define the responsibilities for the security of sites that have been brought into an operational state across the NEOM region. Operational refers to a site that is no longer under construction. This includes all aspects of site security, including: • Operating a secure site or building complex. • Controlling access and maintaining identity management. • Loss prevention, excluding people’s personal items that are not explicitly under the protection of the security provider. • Protection of staff, visitors and other personnel. • Physical protection of data. • Protection of the reputation of the site function, owner and NEOM. If the site is still under construction, or has not been formally handed over, then the security requirements under Schedule S – Construction should still be applied. 2.0 DEFINITIONS The document uses three distinct organisations: • NEOM – Refers to the client organisation, their divisions and their duties in relation to construction security. • OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) – Refers to the organisation or company that utilises the site for its intended primary function, or the management organisation for the site. This entity may be part of NEOM or a private organisation appointed by NEOM. • SECURITY SUPPLIER – Refers to the security provider employed by the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER), or in certain cases, NEOM, to provide security of the site and its associated activities. 3.0 APPLICABILITY This document, and its requirements, apply to all operational sites that are operated within NEOM, or on behalf of NEOM. The exception to this is only where NEOM Security Department (NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY have granted a waiver to this Standard because the site needs to operate at a higher security level. This may be the case with some sites in their end state operation, or where the site is designated Critical Regional Infrastructure (CRI). 4.0 SCOPE The scope of this document covers all operational sites and related activity undertaken by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER). The document sets the minimum standards that are mandatory for the safe and secure operation of the site within NEOM. The aim of the mandatory minimum standards is to: • Set minimum standards to meet the general security threat situation in NEOM. • Provide a consistent approach to security within NEOM avoiding areas of increased vulnerability. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 5.0 RESPONSIBILITIES NEOM are responsible for overall regional security and over-seeing the secure operation of sites within the NEOM region and also the regulation of private security within the NEOM region. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible to NEOM for the security of the operational site, their operations within NEOM and wider KSA related to the site, supply chain, administration and supporting corporate offices. This includes activities that may have a potentially negative effect on the reputation of NEOM. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) shall provide 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year (24/7/365) security to mitigate the identified security risks. Risk is a dynamic element, and the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) should plan to review their related security risk: • On a periodic basis. • After an incident or near miss event. • If advised to do so by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY • Making the necessary adjustments if the threat level has increased. Security measures should never be reduced beyond the relevant minimum level for the category of the site, as this is likely to reduce the deterrent effect achieved. To achieve the security requirements, the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) must either provide a suitably qualified in-house professional security capability or employ a suitably qualified and resourced SECURITY SUPPLIER. [Referred to hereafter as the SECURITY SUPPLIER.] The SECURITY SUPPLIER must provide sufficient professional security personnel who are suitably trained and equipped, in conjunction with infrastructure provided at the operational site to meet the security requirements mandated by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) through the Operational Site Security Standard. SECURITY PROCESS 6.0 PROCESS The following process will be followed by all OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER(S)) and their SECURITY SUPPLIERS to evidence their compliance with the mandatory security requirements of NEOM operational sites. Compliance will not be a ‘one-off’ event and NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) will audit the site security to ensure the minimum requirements are being met.

SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 6.1 Site Suitability Assessment The Site Suitability Assessment (SSA) is undertaken to confirm that adequate security measures will be in place once the operational security overlay is applied. It should review the infrastructure, which should have been designed to meet the requirements for security and safety at the site, and it is therefore expected that minimal to no changes will be required. This form of a familiarisation visit will help both OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER develop their Security Management Plan and Site Security Instructions, and identify those elements of non-fixed security infrastructure and resourcing to be provided under their contract. This may include radio systems, mobile duress alarms, search mirrors etc. A short report should be produced following the visit and submitted to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) for review and discussion. 7.0 SITE CATEGORISATION Every site within NEOM has been categorised using pre-defined criteria to establish the security risk level to the site and a corresponding Security Tier Level (STL). The STL sets the minimum or baseline security infrastructure standards that must be incorporated into the design of the site to meet the assessed threat in combination with: • An Operational Security Overlay: A Concept of Security Operations will be provided based upon the site design to provide an outline of the operational planning and activities envisioned for the site. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for developing this information into the operational security employer requirements on which the contract with the SECURITY SUPPLIER will be based. • Site Security Procedures and Instructions: The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are responsible for developing the correct level of procedures and instructions for the site, and these will form the basis of the Security Management Plan (Section 8) and the Site Security Instructions (Section 9). It is essential that the security infrastructure is operated and maintained correctly so that it has the desired security effect. Guidance around this is provided in Section 11 – Site Security Infrastructure and Section 12 – Identity Management and Access Control. 8.0 SECURITY MANAGEMENT PLAN The Security Management Plan (SMP) is the responsibility of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER). The SMP should be produced a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the site moving to an operational status. The SMP provides a description of how the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) will meet its security responsibilities. The minimum requirements of the SMP are detailed in Appendix A. The SMP shall be submitted to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) as evidence of adequate security planning having been Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security undertaken. This includes the completion of the SMP Compliance Checklist, which is included at Appendix B to this document and the Security Overlays in Appendix C. As the SMP is the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s responsibility, the Site Security Manager shall be a member of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s employed staff to ensure that the SMP is correctly interpreted and applied to the site. The SMP should evidence the capabilities of the site security infrastructure to allow the SMP to be further developed in sufficient detail with an intimate understanding of the site. To do this, a series of security overlays shall be prepared during the SMP stage. The required minimum overlays are as follows: • Privacy Zoning. • Access Control Overlay and Control Lines. • Dynamic Lockdown Procedure. • Surveillance Overlay Trace. • Intruder Detection Zones. • Search Difficulty Trace. • Evacuation and Invacuation Routes. • Emergency Red Routes. • Muster points. • Incident Control Points, Media Holding Area and Incident Vehicle Control Points. The overlays should be used operationally and incorporated into Security Control Room information and the information used during security activity and incidents. Examples are provided in Appendix C. It should be noted that the SMP is an auditable document. 9.0 SITE SECURITY INSTRUCTION The Site Security Instruction (SSI) is the responsibility of the SECURITY SUPPLIER, to meet the requirements of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s SMP. The SSI defines the procedures and assignment instructions that the SECURITY SUPPLIER will undertake on behalf of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to achieve a safe and secure operational site. An SSI is required for all operational sites regardless of size and complexity. The fully completed SSI must be submitted a minimum of 4 weeks prior to any site being occupied. The minimum requirements of the SSI are detailed in Appendix D. The SSI Compliance Checklist is included at Appendix E. It should be noted that the SSI and its associated contents are auditable documents. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 10.0 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) expects that the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are responsible for the day-to-day application of security at the site under the leadership of the Site Security Manager. However, it is beneficial for certain events, occurrences and incidents to be reported to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC). Therefore, the reporting requirements to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) are for the following three categories: • Management Information. • Information of Suspicious Nature. • Reportable Incidents. Report and Log formats have been standardised to keep consistency of reporting and reference the same across all operational sites. These can be found at Appendix F. 10.1 Management Information The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), through the Site Security Manager, is responsible for ensuring the following management information is provided to the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC), as indicated: Daily: • Reportable Incidents as defined in sub-section 11.3. A Nil Incidents to Report is not required and it will be assumed the absence of a report indicates this. • A Security Daily Activity Log shall be maintained as a complete diary of security activity, events and incidents on the site. These logs must be archived once full for a minimum period of two full calendar years, or longer if specified by local Police regulations, from the last dated entry. Weekly: • Dropped Security Shifts indicating the manpower shortfall and over what periods. • Planned duties/checks that did not occur in the week and the remedial plan to rectify. • Collated ‘Suspicious Activity’ Report. • Complaints registered against security staff, regardless of the outcome. • Occurrences that involve an external agency or government department. Monthly: • Review of site security including Site Security Manager and OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) management comments. • Incident data for the preceding month. See report formats included at Appendix F. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 10.2 Information of a Suspicious Nature Any member of the staff, site users or visitors will be able to record information of suspicious nature via a NEOC . This information will be assessed by the Site Security Manager and any appropriate investigation will be undertaken. Posters, computer banners and other highly viewed media should contain the NEOC number and details around caller confidentiality. A sample poster format is provided below. A collated report must be produced on a weekly basis that lists all reports of suspicious activity so that this can be reviewed for patterns and indicators of other potential occurrences by the Site Security Manager. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security This report shall be forwarded to the NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) Intelligence Lead on a weekly basis, detailing the information received and the details of any follow-on investigations undertaken at a site level. 10.3 Reportable Incidents The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are to be familiar with the requirements of the NEOM Security Incident Management Procedure; this procedure outlines the reporting processes for an incident. NEOM Schedule S - Operations_LINK As a minimum, the following should be reported daily, or immediately dependent upon severity: • Injuries or fatalities. • Security incidents that will affect the normal use of the site. • Arrests or events that have involved outside organisations. • Security breaches. • Major security incidents, including any event that could lead to future media reporting. • Unusual public or media presence or activity. All of the above Reportable Incidents must use the report format included at Attachment 1 to this document. 11.0 SITE SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE The site has been designed and constructed with site security infrastructure based upon the STL assigned to the site. It is imperative that this infrastructure is used effectively and that it is maintained to the highest standard to deliver its required security effect. The following sub- sections define activities that are mandatory for the types of infrastructure and the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER must ensure these are included in the relevant sections of the SMP and SSI. These activities will be audited. 11.1 Perimeter Fence, Wall or Boundary Barriers The site perimeter for any site is a vital barrier to entry, or important demarcation line for the rules and regulations of the site to be enforced. Therefore, there are activities that must be completed by the SECURITY SUPPLIER to ensure the correct level of security is maintained. 11.1.1 Physically Barriered Perimeters The following requirements to maintain security of the site shall be met: • During patrols security staff will ensure that sections of the perimeter are visually inspected for: o Damage to the fabric of the barrier. o Signs of climbing of the barrier from outside or inside. o Ensuring that climbing aids are not left against the barrier or with a horizontal distance of 2.0m of the barrier on either side. o Ensuring vehicles are not being parked against the barrier. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o Any signage is still securely attached and has not become unreadable. o Any build up of litter should be reported to facilities management. o Any cover from view screens are still in place. • Attention should be made to ensure that spaces below any barrier are not becoming increased either purposefully or through weather erosion. Where this is occurring, this should be reported for maintenance and repair. • The patrol planning should take into account perimeter checks and also ensure over a weekly period that all areas of the perimeter are visited at least once physically. • Patrol patterns should not be pattern setting. • Observation should be made to identify areas of the perimeter where increased activity has taken place. This should be reported and placed onto the Security Control Room ‘Area-Watchlist’. • Checks should be completed at different times of the day, including dark hours and weekends. • If a breach in the barrier is discovered it should be reported immediately and security staff should remain at the breach until effective repairs have been completed, where a secure perimeter has been installed. • Patrols should assess lighting at the perimeter and report any damaged or partially operating lighting to facilities management for maintenance and repair. 11.1.2 Non-Physically Barriered Perimeters The following requirements to maintain security of the site shall be met: • Patrols should be tasked along the perimeter line of the site and pay particular attention to transition points on and off the site. • Patrols should check that any signage at the perimeter is secure and has not become unreadable or defaced. • Particular attention should be paid to areas where evidence of entry or exit has occurred that is not along a desired movement corridor. This should be reported to the SCR and placed upon the Security Control Room ‘Area Watchlist’. • Patrols should look for acts of anti-social behaviour, gatherings etc that will affect the reputation of the site. Where this is occurring then this should be discussed with the Site Security Manager to plan a long-term approach to prevention. • Patrols should assess lighting at the perimeter and report any damaged or partially operating lighting to facilities management for maintenance and repair. 11.2 Video Surveillance System To support the physical site perimeter and operational overlay, video cameras may have been installed to provide coverage of the perimeter line and access points into the site. It is assumed that each site will have a dedicated location within either the Guard Post or a dedicated Security Control Room to pro-actively manage the camera coverage. Advice and requirements for VSS/CCTV please contact NEOM Public Safety - Security Director for Command and Control prior to your RFP procurement request. The Visual Surveillance System (VSS/CCTV) should be used to: • Provide strong situational awareness across the site to support operational security. • Provide a verification method for any intrusion alarms. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Provide the ability to perform virtual guard tours. • Provide the ability for targeted observation. • Record images for a minimum of 90 days for post recording review as required. • Provide verification of events, incidents and occurrences where the chain of actions need to be established. • Support incident response activity. OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) need to be fully trained and compliant with any local regulations. The system must be reviewed regularly to ensure cameras are providing the images and image quality expected of the system. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is expected in conjunction with the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to ensure regular cleaning is undertaken in-line with any maintenance agreement. 11.3 Security Lighting and other External Illumination All security lighting and external lighting that aids safety and security should be inspected on a regular basis to ensure it is functional, undamaged and providing the required illumination. Where this is not the case, this should be reported to facilities management for maintenance and repair. Security staff should ensure that torches, hand-held or temporary illumination devices are serviceable and fully charged prior to dark hours shifts so that sufficient resilience and redundancy is present should a failure in fixed illumination occur. This is especially important at entry/exit points on the site. Dirty lights should be reported to facilities management for maintenance. Patrols must operate in safe lighting conditions but beyond strongly lit areas to be able to provide observation of less well lit areas. Night-time patrol planning should take account of this requirement to ensure that all areas of the site are adequately patrolled. 11.4 Security Guard Posts Security Guard Posts will be fixed infrastructure at the main ingress / egress point(s), to monitor and control movement onto and off site. These locations will serve as the Vehicle Access Control Points and Pedestrian Access Control Points for the site and are therefore vital to maintaining the required security level for the site. The Security Guard Posts are to be maintained and operated to the highest standards as these form the first impression that users and visitors of the site form about the professionalism and effectiveness of both site security, but also the wider site operations standard. A key element of the perception of the Security Guard Post will be formed on the following factors: • Cleanliness and neatness of the area. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Proactive, friendly and helpful interaction with security staff. • Robust, but polite removal of unauthorised people and vehicles. • Serviceability of all infrastructure in the area, especially elements such as shade cover, lighting etc that are very visual elements. • Timely processing of visitors to the right location with the right information and guidance. Staff attitude is key, and a concierge approach should be adopted. Site entry/exit procedures and the Security Guard Posts will be a principal focus of audits and also should correspondingly serve as an important measure of user satisfaction with security services. 11.5 Radio and Cellular Security Communications The SECURITY SUPPLIER will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of a site wide radio system for security personnel. The radio system must provide full coverage of the site, but is not required for communication to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC). It is however, expected that the SECURITY SUPPLIER will also operate and maintain cellular phones for contact beyond the site boundaries. Communication equipment can be either supplied by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) or SECURITY SUPPLIER. The following requirements must be met: • A radio communications system connecting all security personnel including static points and also mobile patrols. • The system must be able to operate over a number of channels, providing for at least: o A core channel for day to day operations as the standard communications channel. o A minimum of two minor-incident channels to allow for separation of communication whilst still being able to operate the standard core channel. o One emergency channel is to be designated as the first-use channel for any incident. This will assist the fire and first aid responders to be ready for the incident as early as possible, but avoid the daily security ‘chatter’ of the standard daily channel. o A major emergency channel, reserved for usage under the authorisation of the Site Security Manager. o A management channel. • Enough radio communications equipment to ensure each member of staff on shift has a radio and enough spare batteries, spare parts and charging points. • One radio, spare battery and charger to be provided to the site fire control room or site fire officer for response requirements. Part of the security supervisor’s daily checks is to ensure that radios are charged and set to the correct first-use emergency channel. • Two radios, spare batteries and chargers are to be provided to the site first aid clinic. Part of the security supervisor’s daily checks is to ensure that radios are charged and set to the correct first-use emergency channel. • Information security should be maintained through correct usage of the radio system and sensitive information should not be passed over the radio unless completely necessary, or as part of an emergency situation. • OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) should be trained that conversations can be overheard by those close to them, and as standard all OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) should be issued with a single ear piece to help prevent eavesdropping. Radios should not be over-loud to disturb users of the site unnecessarily. • The site should demonstrate that if the radio system fails, that they have sufficient Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security secondary communications capability to manage a major incident. This should include the evidence of pre-programmed phone numbers etc, if the back-up if a fixed or cellular phone option. 11.6 Emergency Routes The site will have a number of established emergency routes. These routes should be treated as ‘Red Routes’ or routes that should not be blocked, congested or compromised in any way, as they represent the key firefighting routes, incident management or medical evacuation routes. Therefore, the following requirements should be met: • Only authorised vehicle parking spaces should be used. Unauthorised vehicle parking should be prevented. • Routes should be kept clear for the unhindered passage of 4.0m in width. • In an emergency these routes should be patrolled and controlled by security staff equipped with radio systems, and traffic control equipment. • Routes should be checked as part of mobile patrols regularly and on a continuous basis, including during dark hours. • A reference map of these routes should be kept in all guard posts and the SCR at all times. ‘Rip-off’ sheets of the map or copies should be kept to allow quick issue to emergency responders as required. • Users of the site should be made aware of restrictions for vehicle parking and other obstructions on these routes and the reason why. Alongside this should be an awareness briefing of valid parking spaces around the site, off-loading points and the procedures for needing to obstruct a Red Route. • An assessment procedure should be developed by the Site Security Manager for requests to obstruct a Red Route, so security shifts can be made aware of this, its duration and the alternative Red Routes that should be used during this period. • Red Routes should be developed in consultation with the Site Fire Officer. 11.7 Mass Notification The ability to provide mass notification or mass messaging should be designed into the infrastructure for the site to satisfy both fire and security regulations. The NEOC should be the single point of contact to coordinate all mass notifications at NEOM sites. It is recommended that the adoption of a cellular phone solution is also adopted to allow mass notification to regular site users and registered visitors via a SMS message should there be reasons not to attend the site. This would need to be completed by the NEOM digital presence that each individual has, and it is therefore recognised should include all registered users, residents and digital nomads. A similar system using computer monitor active banners should also be considered for a similar notification purpose, and also so security and other messages, that are not of immediate importance, can be reinforced across site users. Dependent on the type and severity of emergency situation that emerges OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER(S)) should also consider, in consultation with NEOM, the use of local media such as television or radio broadcasting stations to promulgate mass notification messages if the incident covers a large area and requires the restriction of vehicles or people passing the area. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 11.8 Muster Points Muster points for users of the site must be established, and site users must be made aware of the relevant muster point to them. Again, this activity should be coordinated with the Site Fire Officer. The muster points and their use have the following requirements: • Provide sufficient space for the site occupancy levels. • Provide sufficient space away from potential sources of vulnerability or threat. • Security staff should be dispatched to muster points as quickly as possible and should complete a visual search of the muster point to ensure it is safe for use. • Be usable during both daylight and dark hours safely. • Consider the duration of use and protection from the environment as appropriate. Those mustering will have only brought essential items, so thought should be given to having basic items available, such as drinking water. • Cover both evacuation and invacuation scenarios. • Provide sufficient flexibility that site users can be directed to specific muster points if required. • Use of muster points should be exercised/practised at least annually. • Maps showing the muster points must be displayed in the guard posts and SCR as a minimum. • All staff and regular users of the site should be aware of their corresponding muster point. • Site visitors must be made aware of the muster point they should use and if relevant, who their guide will be. • The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for ensuring a muster system is in place that allows the quick and effective accounting for all personnel on the site. It is recommended that this is an automated check-in system wherever possible to expedite the process and allow responders to focus on critical issues. This system should be linked to the system in place for ensuring buildings are clear of personnel in an emergency. • As some incidents may be on-going and deny access to buildings or other locations, the selection of secondary holding areas should be planned. These must provide protection from the environment and provide basic needs like access to toilet facilities, food and water etc. • The muster point commander should provide information updates to those being held at the muster point to maintain order and prevent site users making their own decisions to move from the muster point. • Standard equipment needed by security staff, above and beyond, their standard equipment will be: o High Visibility Vests. o A loud hailer to enhance the ability to broadcast voice messages. o A first aid response pack. o Any muster point devices. These must be charged and ready to use at any time, including up to date data if the system requires it. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 11.9 Incident Control Points Incident Control Points (ICPs) are vital to the effective command and control of an incident and the following points must be planned and briefed to all site responders, not just security staff: • ICPs – a network of these should be planned and be referenced by unambiguous naming. This will allow for the selection of the most appropriate ICPs for the incident. • Media Holding and Briefing Area – this must be a suitable location, preferably indoors where the media can be consolidated and briefed on mass as required. The location should be away from likely incident areas to avoid the incident unfolding in front of them. • Vehicle Holding Points – in any incident it is likely that numerous vehicles may arrive at the site. A large enough area of parking provision to hold the vehicles at should be identified. In that it must not constrain the movement of other vehicles along any ‘Red Routes’. The minimum requirements for each location are outlined below. 11.9.1 ICPs • Sited away from distractions. • Sufficient capacity for the number of people to be likely hosted. • Be sited as to not be bypassed to get to the incident area or have controlled access to the incident area. • Provide lighting, power and data as a minimum. If it is expected that the ICP may be used for some time, it should be sited in a safe building or covered external area with access to toilets, catering etc. • Provide an easily recognisable point, so it is easy for authorised people to find. • Provide sufficient planning and working space for all personal to perform their duties. • Have communications links to the locations that follow: o SCR. o Security Gatehouses. o Vehicle Holding Points. 11.9.2 Media Holding and Briefing Area • Sited at an easily accessible point of the site. • Adjacent to a parking area. • Positioned at a location unlikely to be affected by the incident directly. • Provide a covered or indoor location for briefing of the media. • In a location where the media can be controlled to not gain access further into the site. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 11.9.3 Vehicle Holding Points • Sufficient holding/parking space for the anticipated vehicles. • Ability to keep access routes clear of vehicles. • Traffic control equipment. • Sufficient lighting for dark hours. • Prior to the ICPs. 11.10 Security Control Room The Site Security Manager and Security Control Room (SCR) Supervisors will ensure the following duties are completed as a minimum as indicated: Continuous • Provide situational awareness for the site to ensure safety and security of all site users. • Provide a competent and active response to all situations as required. • Provide a constant point of contact for internal and external requirements. • Assist security and other staff as required to resolve events, occurrences and incidents. • Manage information passage and assist during an incident, whilst the ICP manages stakeholders and responders. • Support external emergency responses to the site. • Maintain a record of all relevant activity to help improve safety and security on-site. Daily • Visual observation check of all camera views to ensure they are not degraded, dirty or require adjustment. • Check of any amendments made to the access control database, including privilege changes. • Run a report on failed entry attempts at access control points. • Run system diagnostic reports, taking appropriate action for any maintenance issues. Shift Changeover • A handover brief is conducted between all staff. • Check to ensure that relevant logs are accessible. • Check that emergency and contingency information is accessible. • Log any outstanding actions from the previous shift for action during the current shift. • Check all radios are charged or charging and set to the correct channel. • Complete a radio check with all standard radio users. • Ensure all planned occurrences during the shift are known, such as fire alarm tests etc. • Ensure all on-coming staff have attending a SIT, see Section 15.5. • Functionality check of all security systems is undertaken by the on-coming OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)). • Ensure at least one member of staff overlaps between main shift changes to provide continuity. Foster and Encourage • Foster an environment of checking and verifying as information received may be inaccurate and can be influenced by biases of interpretation and personal perception. • Establish open communications and good relationships within the control room, and Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security between the control room and the security officers on the ground to reduce barriers to reporting. • Encourage the team to understand human and technical limitations, and work together to ensure maximum coverage of eyes and ears on the ground. • Don’t rely on technology; for example, if logging technology does not enable all relevant information to be captured ensure that an alternative logging repository is available. 11.11 Duress Alarms All security staff and reception staff should be briefed on the location of any fixed duress alarms that have been installed as part of the base build program. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER should complete a review of the distribution of duress alarms around the site to ensure there are sufficient alarms points for how the site will be operated and the inherent risk that would require activation of a duress alarm. Where the distribution of duress alarms is not deemed correct for the site operations, the SECURITY SUPPLIER should provide mobile duress alarm devices either as part of the security communications equipment or as a separate device for its staff. Any duress alarms should be transmitted to the SCR for immediate follow-on investigation. 11.12 Building Security Security staff have a responsibility for general building security on the site unless this is responsibility of a specific building user. The following requirements should be met where instructed by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) as part of the general security duties for the site: • Out of hours checks: Door and window security. • Security patrols to include building areas as a deterrent to criminal activity. • Parking area checks to ensure valid permits are shown. • Vehicles have not been parked in drop-off and short stay zones. • Plant room doors and access are secure. • Waste has not been left against buildings where it could become a fire hazard. • Report any damage that is a potential security risk to the relevant facilities management team, and record in the daily security log. 12.0 IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND ACCESS CREDENTIALS The SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible for ensuring that a robust identity management and access credential process is implemented at each operational site. This should include sufficient processes for onboarding, issuing of credentials and manage all site users. In particular, the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) should ensure that they implement sufficient methods to control, recover and audit the issuing or all access credentials; including expired or lost cards. The SECURITY SUPPLIER, through delegated responsibility from the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), is responsible for implementing the identity management and access credential policies to ensure that all users within the site have the appropriate level of access. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security All personnel ID cards shall be linked to biometric readers that positively links the individual to the ID information presented. It is the responsibility of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to set out within the SMP what biometric information is required of personnel and to include this with the SSI. Systems should be integrated with the NEOM digital identification signature that is common across the region. This should reduce the burden upon the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) for the bulk issuing of credentials, dependent on the type of facility. The SECURITY SUPPLER is responsible for ensuring that the following processes are undertaken in setting up and managing the identity management system: • Develop an Identity Management Database that sets out the following information: o Full name. o Credential issue date. o Credential expiry date. o ID number. o Job title. o Passport / Iqama number. o Photograph. o User access level (What areas of the site, and when are the permitted access). o Site induction training in date (y/n). o Biometric data. • The SECURITY SUPPLIER should also ensure that a separate Visitor Identity Management database is established to record access onto and off the site. This should capture the following information: o Visitors full name. o Visitors sponsor / escort name for the visit. o Has authorisation been received for the visit (y/n). o Expected time and date of arrival. o Visitor access privileges. o Visitor site induction training. o Require multi-day pass (e.g. Contractor). • The security guard staff at the entrance into site shall ensure that all personnel and visitors possess the appropriate authorisation to enter the site. • Security staff should check that all personnel and visitors display ID pass at all times when within the NEOM site. • The Security Manager should plan a monthly audit to check and report on the following: o Incident reports (e.g. tailgating, reported breaches). o Revocation of access credentials. o Numbers of new credentials issued. o Numbers of credentials expired and follow-on confirmations. o Lost and stolen ID credentials. o Unused access credentials (flag non-use >3 weeks) by access zones. Enrolment For all new personnel working at the site or requiring regular access, an onboarding process will need to be instigated to enrol the individual. To initiate this process, the Security Manager or Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security authorised security staff member, should receive an authorisation to enrol request from an appropriate manager within the NEOM site. For the individual, they should supply the required information, biometric information and undergo a site enrolment prior to be granted an access credential. Termination For personnel who have left the organisation or no longer require access to the site, the SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible for removing the access credentials following notification from the Site Security Manager, as appropriate. This process should include recovering the individual’s credential and updating the identity management database of the user’s access rights. Visitors Further to the required information set out above, the SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible to ensure that the following is undertaken when a visitors arrives at site: • Request evidence of identification. • Ensure the visitor signs in the visitor's gate log. • Request the name of the person that the visitor wishes to visit. • Notify (by telephone/radio) the person that the visitor wishes to meet to determine if that person is available. • Check current visitor listing to determine if the visitor is permitted on the site without an escort. • Issue a visitor's pass. • If an unescorted visitor, direct the visitor to the appropriate area of the site. If the visitor is to be escorted, they must wait the security station until an escort arrives. 13.0 SITE ACCESS CONTROL – VEHICLES All vehicles accessing the NEOM sites will be required to be either authorised NEOM vehicles or subject to a security check. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible for ensuring the following requirements to are met at the vehicle access control points into site: • All vehicles will need to hold an authorised site vehicle permit which shall be issued and managed by the SECURITY SUPPLIER on behalf of the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER). • All authorised vehicles will be tied to named authorised personnel who have access rights to the site. This may alter only for official site vehicles that are used by multiple employees. • The vehicle permits and corresponding access database shall contain the following information: o Vehicle licence plate number. o Named driver(s). o Named driver(s) access credential pass details for site and photograph. o Vehicle permit number. o Issue date. o Expiry date. • For deliveries to site, security staff shall check the driver and contents against the manifest and pre-arrival information, which will contain the following minimum details: o Vehicle licence plate number Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o Driver name. o Expected ETA. o Delivery type and content details. o Site point of contact, contact details. • All deliveries onto site shall be recorded prior to arrival on a delivery scheduling system to assist the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) in coordinating and planning delivery timeslots. 13.1 Site Access for Vehicles The SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible to the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to ensure: • Security guards only allow authorised vehicles onto the site with a valid vehicle permit. • Vehicle permits are strictly controlled and only issued as necessary, and only for the duration needed. • In the event that an unauthorised vehicle arrives at site, the Guard Staff should investigate and reject the vehicle and not permit it entry onto site. • All deliveries are checked against the delivery schedule issued by the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER). • Vehicle access for visitors should be limited and they shall park either externally to the site if practicable or within a designated visitor parking area of the site. They can then either walk, be escorted or collected from the entry point. • If in doubt, then the security guard should deny access to the site and seek clarification. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) shall support this approach to maintain the security of the site. 14.0 PERSONNEL SECURITY The following considerations should be made for the employment of security personnel and other staff who will have access to sensitive information. • Background and employment checks for all security employees appropriate to their employment and access to information. To include: o Verification of prior employment. o Criminal record checks. o Driving licence checks if part of their employment duties. o Reference checks. • Provision of access rights to all staff must be approved by a line manager to confirm they require access to the area and confirmed by the Site Security Manager for specified areas. These would include server rooms, sensitive data storage rooms, certain private offices etc. It is expected that the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), or site businesses/management company will complete appropriate vetting and background checks for other employees, residents and regular users. 15.0 TRAINING, AWARENESS AND EXERCISES The overarching training plan for security staff should have the following specific aims: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Ensuring all staff are adequately trained to complete their duties before the commencement of any shift. This also includes briefings to prepare them for known shift occurrences. • Provide continual professional development to improve the year on year service standards, site safety and site security standards. Audits conducted by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) assess the trained standard of security staff. The requirements should be specified by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to the SECURITY SUPPLIER through compliance to the SMP. The SECURITY SUPPLIER will be responsible for developing the training and exercise plan for agreement with the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER). 15.1 Onboarding The On-Boarding training package must be submitted to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) for approval within 4 weeks of being awarded the contract for the site.

This may be targeted to a more limited number of staff for more advanced techniques. • Annual first aid training must include the use of vital life-saving equipment such as defibrillators. 15.3 Specialist Training Requirements Selected security personnel shall undertake: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Vehicle search training – ratio of least one trained OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner) per gate shift. • Camera OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner) training – number based upon SCR staffing requirements. • More advanced first aid training – 20% of security staff. 15.4 Training Exercises Security training exercises should be planned where a resulting security incident would be safety critical. Therefore, the following potential incidents must be exercised at least annually: • Emergency evacuation of the site, including the use of muster areas and accounting for all personnel on the site. • Emergency evacuation of accommodation buildings, including the use of muster areas and accounting for personnel. This must include night time exercising when the site is at its most vulnerable. • Security incident at the main entrance gate, including immediate action drills, control of internal traffic and people approaching the gate, control of external traffic and people approaching the gate and alternative access procedures. • Presence of an active shooter on the site. • A bomb threat at a known and unknown location. • A medical emergency with the injury of least 5 personnel following a significant incident on-site. This should include the simulation of ‘life-saving’ first aid and evacuation to either local medical assistance and/or medical evacuation. • A breach of the site perimeter, if applicable, or building perimeter if not. 15.5 Shift Improvement Talks As part of the daily working routine all oncoming security personnel will attend a 10 – 15 minute ‘Shift Improvement Talk’ (SIT) prior to commencing their operational shift. SITs should be conducted by the relevant supervisor or manager and aim to cover topics where frequent reminders are useful to the ability of security personnel to conduct their activities. These may include: • Specific risks or activities relevant to the shift, including unique occurrences at the site. These will include important visitors or events to allow security to enhance its customer service offering. • Previous incidents in the last 24hrs, and indicators to be aware of for similar incidents occurring during their shift. This should include the most effective immediate action to be taken. • Reminder of an Assignment Instruction, and its correct application. • Refresher training on a first aid technique, evacuation or critical life safety aspect of the site. For example, if the site if next to the sea, then prevention of drowning techniques. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 15.6 Competency Assessments The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER personnel must be competent for the role they are undertaking. For specified roles the qualifications and experience must be satisfied as defined by sub-section 18.7. Base level competency will be compliance with the requirements of this schedule, with special regard to On-Boarding and Training. Training records should be maintained for all security personnel, covering their initial training and annual training. Each record will be individual and may be subject to audit. Each session of training undertaken must be recorded with the following minimum details: • Training title. • Training duration. • Date of training. • Outcome of any assessment or attendance confirmed. • Name of the trainer or accreditation organisation. 15.7 Experience and Qualifications Security roles should only be filled by individuals with suitable experience and knowledge.

The 20% sample will be chosen at random by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC). NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) reserve the right to request that any member of the security staff, who does not have adequate experience is replaced with another member of staff who does have the required experience. 16.0 SECURITY PERSONNEL – CODE OF CONDUCT It is vital that all security personnel conduct themselves to the highest possible standard in all their duties. It should be foremost that their role is to protect from harm or loss all users of the site they are assigned to. Security staff goals are to: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Provide a service that prevents site users sustaining injury. • Provide a service that helps prevent loss. • Provide an experience enhancing service to site users. This will be best achieved through a helpful, observant and proactive approach to their duties. • Acting as a site ambassador. The security personnel are likely to be the first impression of staff at a site, and therefore it is vital that this is a strong positive experience for the user. To help security staff achieve the above goals, an acceptable minimum code of conduct is mandatory. Non-compliance with the acceptable minimum code of conduct shall result in disciplinary action proportionate to the misdemeanour. 16.1 Acceptable Conduct All security personnel shall: • Conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner at all times. • To be firm, calm, and courteous in dealing with all people and enforcing the required security actions. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is to ensure their staff are also compliant, courteous and respectful in their dealings with the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s staff, and that a one team approach is nurtured. • To be smartly dressed in the supplied uniform for the duration of their shift. (See also the next sub-section). • To be punctual for their shift leaving sufficient time to be at their allocated post on time, with the right equipment and correctly dressed. • It is not acceptable to smoke whilst on duty, and no smoking should be undertaken in vehicles at any time. • It is not acceptable to use a personal mobile phone whilst on duty. • Not to misuse / make unnecessary or private phone calls whilst on duty. • Not to sleep whilst on duty. • Food should only be consumed during scheduled break periods. Special arrangements during Ramadan will be put in place. • Possession of drugs, alcohol or illegal substances whilst on duty will result in dismissal. • Do not allow personal relationships to influence professional behaviour. • Do not allow a group or individual to bring undue influence or pressure to bear on security operations. If in doubt, apply the taught security procedures, the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) will support reasonable behaviour. • Maintaining confidentiality of site information, activities, personnel and security procedures at all times. • Do not engage in any other commercial or political activity, of any kind, whilst on duty. • Only the following jewellery may be worn whilst on duty, wrist watch, medical bracelet and a wedding ring. All other jewellery should be removed prior to starting the shift. • Tattoos should not be visible whilst wearing the supplied uniform. Members of staff found not complying with the Acceptable Code of Conduct should be subject to management improvement or disciplinary procedures. 16.2 Uniform and Standards of Dress Smartly dressed and cleanliness is defined as: • Uniform has been washed and pressed. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Boots have been cleaned. The wearing of sandals or non-issue footwear is not acceptable. • Any damage to the uniform has been competently repaired or the article replaced. • Maintaining a good standard of personnel cleanliness, including daily washing, neat hair and facial hair. 16.3 Standard Equipment All security personnel shall be issued with the following equipment to support the delivery of their daily assigned activities: • Serviceable and suitable uniforms x No. 3 per man (minimum). • Cold and wet weather clothing. • Hi-visibility vest – to be used where required based on task safety risk assessment. • Suitable boots. • Gloves suitable to their tasking, examples being: o Vehicle searching – protective gloves from dirt etc. o People or luggage searching – clean tactile gloves. o As a minimum any mobile patrol should carry at least one pair of disposable gloves per person. • Notebooks and pens. • A fully charged torch. • The required radio or mobile communications device. This should be fully charged, and the user should understand the re-charging requirements. • Whistle for attracting attention. • Items indicated in the following sub-section 19.4 Standard Information. The SECURITY SUPPLIER shall ensure that all equipment is maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. Any unserviceable, damaged or lost equipment must be reported as soon as practicable to the relevant supervisor or manager, so that replacement equipment can be issued. It is not acceptable for a shift member to not have the serviceable standard equipment and therefore the shift supervisor must have access to spare items for immediate replacements. All security personnel should undertake familiarisation and safe use training on equipment. Where the equipment is only used periodically, or common mistakes dictate, refresher training should be provided. All security staff must wear the appropriate PPE for the task being undertaken. Tasks should be risk assessed by the SECURITY SUPPLIER and the relevant safety actions taken. Unsafe practices or the lack of an adequate safety risk assessment will not be tolerated. 16.4 Standard Information It is essential that each member of security staff carries a minimum ‘Reference Aide Memoire’ of vital information for the site they are employed upon. This should include the relevant security and emergency/incident management information referenced in this document and the SMP and SSI. However, the security staff are also on site to aid the efficient operation of the site. To help achieve this, it is required that security staff include in the aide memoire general site information. This information should consist of, but not be limited to: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Maps/diagrams showing: o The site layout with any sensitive area information removed. o Parking areas. o Pedestrian movement routes to help explain how to reach certain locations. o Locations of facilities, such as toilets or first aid points. o Defibrillator unit locations. • Maps/diagrams should contain simple annotation in the common languages spoken by regular users of the site. As a minimum, this must be in Arabic and English. • The Public Relations/Media Enquiry contact telephone number. • Opening and closing times if applicable. • The prohibited item list in a pictogram form. • Emergency procedures and relevant information such as muster points etc. • Standard note book event recording formats of the information that will be required to be entered into the daily security log. • Blacklist or Watchlist details for individuals or vehicles. • Complaints forms to issue to site users if requested, and details of where these should be deposited. • Help desk telephone numbers. 16.5 Security Vehicles The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) should ensure that security vehicles comply with the following: • Wherever security personnel are present at a site, they will require access to a security vehicle. The number of vehicles should be scaled to the number of security personnel and the number of static tasks and mobile tasks. • Suitable for the terrain or movement corridors of the site. • Clearly marked as security vehicles on front, both sides and rear. Any lettering should be readable from a minimum distance of 20.0m. • Correctly registered, have proof of insurance and an up to date maintenance record. • Contain not less than half a tank of fuel at any point in time. • 4x4 SUV, 2018 or newer models. • Each vehicle should carry the following minimum equipment: o Comprehensive emergency first aid kit (x 1). o Emergency flashlight (x 1). o Fire extinguishers (x 2). o Fire Blanket (x 1), suitable for use on a person. o Jumper cable, for starting other vehicles (x 1). o Light bar (orange colour). o Recovery strap (x 1). o Sand shovel (x 1). o Small traffic cones (x 4). o A roll of warning tape, minimum 25.0m. o Traffic control wand (stop / go) – battery operated (x 2). o Vehicle mounted radio communications. o Vehicle tyre changing equipment and spare wheel. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o 5 Litres of potable drinking water in sealed bottles for emergency use. • Contain breakdown and recovery contact cards. • Drivers should complete 1st Parade Vehicle Checks before using a vehicle daily. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is to prepare the 1st Parade Check List and ensure drivers are suitably trained and follow the requirements. An example 1st parade checklist is given below. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security All drivers must hold a valid KSA driving licence and be adequately covered by the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s insurance. Drivers should also be familiar with the vehicle they have been asked to drive and it is the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s responsibility to ensure safe driving practices are enforced for its staff. Security vehicles should never be used for personal use. On large sites where frequent trips are made by security staff, other than completing patrols, the use of well maintained, SECURITY SUPPLIER issued bicycles is acceptable. In these cases, the user must check the cycle prior to riding to ensure it is in good working order and they must be competent at riding the bicycle and obey the traffic rules for the site. 17.0 AUDITS Periodic audits will be completed of the security provided at each and every site. The audit will be conducted by a member of NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC), and may be a pre-notified event or snap audit. The aim of the audit is to: • Assess the level of security being provided at a site. • Assess that the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are providing the mandatory minimum standard of security for each site as agreed through the SMP and SSI. • Ensure the requirements of the contract for security are being met. • Assist the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER in being efficient in their provision of security at the site. Therefore, improving their service. The audit will be completed against standard templates to ensure consistency of assessment and that the correct requirements are being assessed. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is strongly encouraged to fully understand the SMP and SSI, and their requirements to ensure they are compliant at all times. The lead for any audit activity will be the Site Security Manager Audits may consider any requirement under Operational Site Security, and requirements stated in the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s SMP or SECURITY SUPPLIER’s SSI. Audits are intended as opportunities to improve the services being provided and are conducted in conjunction with the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER. 18.0 COMMUNITY APPROACH TO SECURITY 18.1 User Communication Security should adopt the practice of regularly briefing regular site users, or the community, about security issues. This may include ‘text drops’ or ‘internet banners’ reinforcing the common security messages and making them aware of activities on the site as appropriate. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Whilst some messages reinforce the right behaviour on the site, the use of positive security marketing should also be used to allow controlled release of security information that will have a deterrent effect on any potential criminal activity. This may include statements around ‘regular non-pattern setting well-resourced patrols’, which provides reassurance to some members of the community, but sows the seed of doubt in the mind of potential criminals that they do not know when patrols will be happening, and that they are prepared to deal with situations properly. Education around things to do and not to do is also a strong way to reinforce the security message in the community and also tell the community what is acceptable and what is not acceptable behaviour. It is therefore expected that an element of the SMP should include for positive security marketing. 18.2 Attitude Attitude of all security personnel will support the ‘look and feel’ of the site for regular users, supply chain and visitors. In line with the code of conduct it is imperative that all security personnel support a friendly, welcoming and helpful approach to their tasks. All too often a ‘stand-offish’ or ‘rude ignoring’ attitude is adopted by security personnel, and this creates an unwelcoming environment. Security personnel should be encouraged to talk with site users and visitors, and this will have a positive effect on how the role of security is viewed on the site. Security personnel should be guided to understand their role is ensuring security and safety but this does not have to be applied in an aggressive or elusive manner. The ‘concierge’ of the site is a more appropriate attitude approach, that will then foster dialogue between site users and security personnel. 18.3 De-Escalation of Conflict / Aggression Community confidence in the security staff to be fair and impartial is vital. This is extremely true when dealing with situations of conflict or aggression. The approach to be adopted in all scenarios is to de-escalate the situation in a way that calms behaviour, not encourages violence. To achieve this all security staff should be briefed and trained in an appropriate Use of Force policy. The policy should default to the lowest level of force to resolve the situation. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Force Level Intervention Description Lowest Using the physical presence of security staff at a Presence safe, but clearly visible distance, to disperse or disrupt aggressive behaviors. Direct verbal interaction with those involved in Verbal the scenario to calm tensions and seek a peaceful resolution to the situation. Use of only those techniques taught as part of official SECURITY SUPPLIER training, and always Unarmed Restraint using the minimum force to make the technique effective. Wherever possible, this option should not cause any injury. Requested Police support and allow the Police Police Highest to take primacy in the situation. In all cases the SCR must be informed prior to any intervention so they are able to monitor the situation and provide support as necessary. 19.0 EMERGENCY AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) is to ensure that a robust emergency and incident management structure is put in place on the site to deal with not only security events, but other events or incidents that could affect the site. These will be documented in the Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is a living document that all managers and supervisors should have read. All staff should be aware of their part in an event occurring, and the document should be periodically reviewed and amended where required. The ERP is owned by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and is their responsibility to brief, practice and resource adequately. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) as a minimum should appoint the following responsibilities: • Strategic, Tactical and Operational Commanders. • Emergency Command Centre Manager. • Information Technology. • Insurance Liaison. • Legal Advisor. • Facilities, Administration and Government Affairs. • Media Communications Representative. • Finance and Emergency Procurement Representative. • Health and Safety Representative. • Human Resources Representative. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Business Continuity Representative. Dependent on the size of the enterprise it may be that individual members of the Emergency Management Team will have to adopt dual roles. It should also be noted that not all of these roles will be required for all incidents, and therefore a first task is to decide what members of the team are required. 20.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) The procedures for dealing with emergencies that affect beyond the operational site will be detailed in the NEOM Emergency Response Plan. Both OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER must be familiar with this document and its application. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for drafting the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP will be a separate document to the SMP and SSI, as it will require wider distribution amongst staff members. All personnel must be briefed to the relevant level of detail for their role in responding to an event, incident or emergency on the site. The ERP will be reviewed by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) on the following occasions: • Twice yearly as a minimum. • Following audit comments being received from a NEOM department. • Following an incident, event or occurrence on site that required a response covered in the ERP. • Where the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) believes there is an omission of a response plan due to changing site circumstances. A recommended minimum contents for the ERP are included at Appendix G.

SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security GENERAL 1.0 PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to clearly define the responsibilities for the security of sites that have been brought into an operational state across the NEOM region. Operational refers to a site that is no longer under construction. This includes all aspects of site security, including: • Operating a secure site or building complex. • Controlling access and maintaining identity management. • Loss prevention, excluding people’s personal items that are not explicitly under the protection of the security provider. • Protection of staff, visitors and other personnel. • Physical protection of data. • Protection of the reputation of the site function, owner and NEOM. If the site is still under construction, or has not been formally handed over, then the security requirements under Schedule S – Construction should still be applied. 2.0 DEFINITIONS The document uses three distinct organisations: • NEOM – Refers to the client organisation, their divisions and their duties in relation to construction security. • OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) – Refers to the organisation or company that utilises the site for its intended primary function, or the management organisation for the site. This entity may be part of NEOM or a private organisation appointed by NEOM. • SECURITY SUPPLIER – Refers to the security provider employed by the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER), or in certain cases, NEOM, to provide security of the site and its associated activities. 3.0 APPLICABILITY This document, and its requirements, apply to all operational sites that are operated within NEOM, or on behalf of NEOM. The exception to this is only where NEOM Security Department (NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY have granted a waiver to this Standard because the site needs to operate at a higher security level. This may be the case with some sites in their end state operation, or where the site is designated Critical Regional Infrastructure (CRI). 4.0 SCOPE The scope of this document covers all operational sites and related activity undertaken by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER). The document sets the minimum standards that are mandatory for the safe and secure operation of the site within NEOM. The aim of the mandatory minimum standards is to: • Set minimum standards to meet the general security threat situation in NEOM. • Provide a consistent approach to security within NEOM avoiding areas of increased vulnerability. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 5.0 RESPONSIBILITIES NEOM are responsible for overall regional security and over-seeing the secure operation of sites within the NEOM region and also the regulation of private security within the NEOM region. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible to NEOM for the security of the operational site, their operations within NEOM and wider KSA related to the site, supply chain, administration and supporting corporate offices. This includes activities that may have a potentially negative effect on the reputation of NEOM. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) shall provide 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year (24/7/365) security to mitigate the identified security risks. Risk is a dynamic element, and the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) should plan to review their related security risk: • On a periodic basis. • After an incident or near miss event. • If advised to do so by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY • Making the necessary adjustments if the threat level has increased. Security measures should never be reduced beyond the relevant minimum level for the category of the site, as this is likely to reduce the deterrent effect achieved. To achieve the security requirements, the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) must either provide a suitably qualified in-house professional security capability or employ a suitably qualified and resourced SECURITY SUPPLIER. [Referred to hereafter as the SECURITY SUPPLIER.] The SECURITY SUPPLIER must provide sufficient professional security personnel who are suitably trained and equipped, in conjunction with infrastructure provided at the operational site to meet the security requirements mandated by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) through the Operational Site Security Standard. SECURITY PROCESS 6.0 PROCESS The following process will be followed by all OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER(S)) and their SECURITY SUPPLIERS to evidence their compliance with the mandatory security requirements of NEOM operational sites. Compliance will not be a ‘one-off’ event and NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) will audit the site security to ensure the minimum requirements are being met.

SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 6.1 Site Suitability Assessment The Site Suitability Assessment (SSA) is undertaken to confirm that adequate security measures will be in place once the operational security overlay is applied. It should review the infrastructure, which should have been designed to meet the requirements for security and safety at the site, and it is therefore expected that minimal to no changes will be required. This form of a familiarisation visit will help both OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER develop their Security Management Plan and Site Security Instructions, and identify those elements of non-fixed security infrastructure and resourcing to be provided under their contract. This may include radio systems, mobile duress alarms, search mirrors etc. A short report should be produced following the visit and submitted to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) for review and discussion. 7.0 SITE CATEGORISATION Every site within NEOM has been categorised using pre-defined criteria to establish the security risk level to the site and a corresponding Security Tier Level (STL). The STL sets the minimum or baseline security infrastructure standards that must be incorporated into the design of the site to meet the assessed threat in combination with: • An Operational Security Overlay: A Concept of Security Operations will be provided based upon the site design to provide an outline of the operational planning and activities envisioned for the site. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for developing this information into the operational security employer requirements on which the contract with the SECURITY SUPPLIER will be based. • Site Security Procedures and Instructions: The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are responsible for developing the correct level of procedures and instructions for the site, and these will form the basis of the Security Management Plan (Section 8) and the Site Security Instructions (Section 9). It is essential that the security infrastructure is operated and maintained correctly so that it has the desired security effect. Guidance around this is provided in Section 11 – Site Security Infrastructure and Section 12 – Identity Management and Access Control. 8.0 SECURITY MANAGEMENT PLAN The Security Management Plan (SMP) is the responsibility of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER). The SMP should be produced a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the site moving to an operational status. The SMP provides a description of how the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) will meet its security responsibilities. The minimum requirements of the SMP are detailed in Appendix A. The SMP shall be submitted to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) as evidence of adequate security planning having been Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security undertaken. This includes the completion of the SMP Compliance Checklist, which is included at Appendix B to this document and the Security Overlays in Appendix C. As the SMP is the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s responsibility, the Site Security Manager shall be a member of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s employed staff to ensure that the SMP is correctly interpreted and applied to the site. The SMP should evidence the capabilities of the site security infrastructure to allow the SMP to be further developed in sufficient detail with an intimate understanding of the site. To do this, a series of security overlays shall be prepared during the SMP stage. The required minimum overlays are as follows: • Privacy Zoning. • Access Control Overlay and Control Lines. • Dynamic Lockdown Procedure. • Surveillance Overlay Trace. • Intruder Detection Zones. • Search Difficulty Trace. • Evacuation and Invacuation Routes. • Emergency Red Routes. • Muster points. • Incident Control Points, Media Holding Area and Incident Vehicle Control Points. The overlays should be used operationally and incorporated into Security Control Room information and the information used during security activity and incidents. Examples are provided in Appendix C. It should be noted that the SMP is an auditable document. 9.0 SITE SECURITY INSTRUCTION The Site Security Instruction (SSI) is the responsibility of the SECURITY SUPPLIER, to meet the requirements of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s SMP. The SSI defines the procedures and assignment instructions that the SECURITY SUPPLIER will undertake on behalf of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to achieve a safe and secure operational site. An SSI is required for all operational sites regardless of size and complexity. The fully completed SSI must be submitted a minimum of 4 weeks prior to any site being occupied. The minimum requirements of the SSI are detailed in Appendix D. The SSI Compliance Checklist is included at Appendix E. It should be noted that the SSI and its associated contents are auditable documents. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 10.0 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) expects that the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are responsible for the day-to-day application of security at the site under the leadership of the Site Security Manager. However, it is beneficial for certain events, occurrences and incidents to be reported to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC). Therefore, the reporting requirements to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) are for the following three categories: • Management Information. • Information of Suspicious Nature. • Reportable Incidents. Report and Log formats have been standardised to keep consistency of reporting and reference the same across all operational sites. These can be found at Appendix F. 10.1 Management Information The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), through the Site Security Manager, is responsible for ensuring the following management information is provided to the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC), as indicated: Daily: • Reportable Incidents as defined in sub-section 11.3. A Nil Incidents to Report is not required and it will be assumed the absence of a report indicates this. • A Security Daily Activity Log shall be maintained as a complete diary of security activity, events and incidents on the site. These logs must be archived once full for a minimum period of two full calendar years, or longer if specified by local Police regulations, from the last dated entry. Weekly: • Dropped Security Shifts indicating the manpower shortfall and over what periods. • Planned duties/checks that did not occur in the week and the remedial plan to rectify. • Collated ‘Suspicious Activity’ Report. • Complaints registered against security staff, regardless of the outcome. • Occurrences that involve an external agency or government department. Monthly: • Review of site security including Site Security Manager and OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) management comments. • Incident data for the preceding month. See report formats included at Appendix F. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 10.2 Information of a Suspicious Nature Any member of the staff, site users or visitors will be able to record information of suspicious nature via a NEOC . This information will be assessed by the Site Security Manager and any appropriate investigation will be undertaken. Posters, computer banners and other highly viewed media should contain the NEOC number and details around caller confidentiality. A sample poster format is provided below. A collated report must be produced on a weekly basis that lists all reports of suspicious activity so that this can be reviewed for patterns and indicators of other potential occurrences by the Site Security Manager. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security This report shall be forwarded to the NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) Intelligence Lead on a weekly basis, detailing the information received and the details of any follow-on investigations undertaken at a site level. 10.3 Reportable Incidents The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are to be familiar with the requirements of the NEOM Security Incident Management Procedure; this procedure outlines the reporting processes for an incident. NEOM Schedule S - Operations_LINK As a minimum, the following should be reported daily, or immediately dependent upon severity: • Injuries or fatalities. • Security incidents that will affect the normal use of the site. • Arrests or events that have involved outside organisations. • Security breaches. • Major security incidents, including any event that could lead to future media reporting. • Unusual public or media presence or activity. All of the above Reportable Incidents must use the report format included at Attachment 1 to this document. 11.0 SITE SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE The site has been designed and constructed with site security infrastructure based upon the STL assigned to the site. It is imperative that this infrastructure is used effectively and that it is maintained to the highest standard to deliver its required security effect. The following sub- sections define activities that are mandatory for the types of infrastructure and the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER must ensure these are included in the relevant sections of the SMP and SSI. These activities will be audited. 11.1 Perimeter Fence, Wall or Boundary Barriers The site perimeter for any site is a vital barrier to entry, or important demarcation line for the rules and regulations of the site to be enforced. Therefore, there are activities that must be completed by the SECURITY SUPPLIER to ensure the correct level of security is maintained. 11.1.1 Physically Barriered Perimeters The following requirements to maintain security of the site shall be met: • During patrols security staff will ensure that sections of the perimeter are visually inspected for: o Damage to the fabric of the barrier. o Signs of climbing of the barrier from outside or inside. o Ensuring that climbing aids are not left against the barrier or with a horizontal distance of 2.0m of the barrier on either side. o Ensuring vehicles are not being parked against the barrier. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o Any signage is still securely attached and has not become unreadable. o Any build up of litter should be reported to facilities management. o Any cover from view screens are still in place. • Attention should be made to ensure that spaces below any barrier are not becoming increased either purposefully or through weather erosion. Where this is occurring, this should be reported for maintenance and repair. • The patrol planning should take into account perimeter checks and also ensure over a weekly period that all areas of the perimeter are visited at least once physically. • Patrol patterns should not be pattern setting. • Observation should be made to identify areas of the perimeter where increased activity has taken place. This should be reported and placed onto the Security Control Room ‘Area-Watchlist’. • Checks should be completed at different times of the day, including dark hours and weekends. • If a breach in the barrier is discovered it should be reported immediately and security staff should remain at the breach until effective repairs have been completed, where a secure perimeter has been installed. • Patrols should assess lighting at the perimeter and report any damaged or partially operating lighting to facilities management for maintenance and repair. 11.1.2 Non-Physically Barriered Perimeters The following requirements to maintain security of the site shall be met: • Patrols should be tasked along the perimeter line of the site and pay particular attention to transition points on and off the site. • Patrols should check that any signage at the perimeter is secure and has not become unreadable or defaced. • Particular attention should be paid to areas where evidence of entry or exit has occurred that is not along a desired movement corridor. This should be reported to the SCR and placed upon the Security Control Room ‘Area Watchlist’. • Patrols should look for acts of anti-social behaviour, gatherings etc that will affect the reputation of the site. Where this is occurring then this should be discussed with the Site Security Manager to plan a long-term approach to prevention. • Patrols should assess lighting at the perimeter and report any damaged or partially operating lighting to facilities management for maintenance and repair. 11.2 Video Surveillance System To support the physical site perimeter and operational overlay, video cameras may have been installed to provide coverage of the perimeter line and access points into the site. It is assumed that each site will have a dedicated location within either the Guard Post or a dedicated Security Control Room to pro-actively manage the camera coverage. Advice and requirements for VSS/CCTV please contact NEOM Public Safety - Security Director for Command and Control prior to your RFP procurement request. The Visual Surveillance System (VSS/CCTV) should be used to: • Provide strong situational awareness across the site to support operational security. • Provide a verification method for any intrusion alarms. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Provide the ability to perform virtual guard tours. • Provide the ability for targeted observation. • Record images for a minimum of 90 days for post recording review as required. • Provide verification of events, incidents and occurrences where the chain of actions need to be established. • Support incident response activity. OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) need to be fully trained and compliant with any local regulations. The system must be reviewed regularly to ensure cameras are providing the images and image quality expected of the system. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is expected in conjunction with the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to ensure regular cleaning is undertaken in-line with any maintenance agreement. 11.3 Security Lighting and other External Illumination All security lighting and external lighting that aids safety and security should be inspected on a regular basis to ensure it is functional, undamaged and providing the required illumination. Where this is not the case, this should be reported to facilities management for maintenance and repair. Security staff should ensure that torches, hand-held or temporary illumination devices are serviceable and fully charged prior to dark hours shifts so that sufficient resilience and redundancy is present should a failure in fixed illumination occur. This is especially important at entry/exit points on the site. Dirty lights should be reported to facilities management for maintenance. Patrols must operate in safe lighting conditions but beyond strongly lit areas to be able to provide observation of less well lit areas. Night-time patrol planning should take account of this requirement to ensure that all areas of the site are adequately patrolled. 11.4 Security Guard Posts Security Guard Posts will be fixed infrastructure at the main ingress / egress point(s), to monitor and control movement onto and off site. These locations will serve as the Vehicle Access Control Points and Pedestrian Access Control Points for the site and are therefore vital to maintaining the required security level for the site. The Security Guard Posts are to be maintained and operated to the highest standards as these form the first impression that users and visitors of the site form about the professionalism and effectiveness of both site security, but also the wider site operations standard. A key element of the perception of the Security Guard Post will be formed on the following factors: • Cleanliness and neatness of the area. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Proactive, friendly and helpful interaction with security staff. • Robust, but polite removal of unauthorised people and vehicles. • Serviceability of all infrastructure in the area, especially elements such as shade cover, lighting etc that are very visual elements. • Timely processing of visitors to the right location with the right information and guidance. Staff attitude is key, and a concierge approach should be adopted. Site entry/exit procedures and the Security Guard Posts will be a principal focus of audits and also should correspondingly serve as an important measure of user satisfaction with security services. 11.5 Radio and Cellular Security Communications The SECURITY SUPPLIER will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of a site wide radio system for security personnel. The radio system must provide full coverage of the site, but is not required for communication to NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC). It is however, expected that the SECURITY SUPPLIER will also operate and maintain cellular phones for contact beyond the site boundaries. Communication equipment can be either supplied by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) or SECURITY SUPPLIER. The following requirements must be met: • A radio communications system connecting all security personnel including static points and also mobile patrols. • The system must be able to operate over a number of channels, providing for at least: o A core channel for day to day operations as the standard communications channel. o A minimum of two minor-incident channels to allow for separation of communication whilst still being able to operate the standard core channel. o One emergency channel is to be designated as the first-use channel for any incident. This will assist the fire and first aid responders to be ready for the incident as early as possible, but avoid the daily security ‘chatter’ of the standard daily channel. o A major emergency channel, reserved for usage under the authorisation of the Site Security Manager. o A management channel. • Enough radio communications equipment to ensure each member of staff on shift has a radio and enough spare batteries, spare parts and charging points. • One radio, spare battery and charger to be provided to the site fire control room or site fire officer for response requirements. Part of the security supervisor’s daily checks is to ensure that radios are charged and set to the correct first-use emergency channel. • Two radios, spare batteries and chargers are to be provided to the site first aid clinic. Part of the security supervisor’s daily checks is to ensure that radios are charged and set to the correct first-use emergency channel. • Information security should be maintained through correct usage of the radio system and sensitive information should not be passed over the radio unless completely necessary, or as part of an emergency situation. • OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) should be trained that conversations can be overheard by those close to them, and as standard all OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)) should be issued with a single ear piece to help prevent eavesdropping. Radios should not be over-loud to disturb users of the site unnecessarily. • The site should demonstrate that if the radio system fails, that they have sufficient Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security secondary communications capability to manage a major incident. This should include the evidence of pre-programmed phone numbers etc, if the back-up if a fixed or cellular phone option. 11.6 Emergency Routes The site will have a number of established emergency routes. These routes should be treated as ‘Red Routes’ or routes that should not be blocked, congested or compromised in any way, as they represent the key firefighting routes, incident management or medical evacuation routes. Therefore, the following requirements should be met: • Only authorised vehicle parking spaces should be used. Unauthorised vehicle parking should be prevented. • Routes should be kept clear for the unhindered passage of 4.0m in width. • In an emergency these routes should be patrolled and controlled by security staff equipped with radio systems, and traffic control equipment. • Routes should be checked as part of mobile patrols regularly and on a continuous basis, including during dark hours. • A reference map of these routes should be kept in all guard posts and the SCR at all times. ‘Rip-off’ sheets of the map or copies should be kept to allow quick issue to emergency responders as required. • Users of the site should be made aware of restrictions for vehicle parking and other obstructions on these routes and the reason why. Alongside this should be an awareness briefing of valid parking spaces around the site, off-loading points and the procedures for needing to obstruct a Red Route. • An assessment procedure should be developed by the Site Security Manager for requests to obstruct a Red Route, so security shifts can be made aware of this, its duration and the alternative Red Routes that should be used during this period. • Red Routes should be developed in consultation with the Site Fire Officer. 11.7 Mass Notification The ability to provide mass notification or mass messaging should be designed into the infrastructure for the site to satisfy both fire and security regulations. The NEOC should be the single point of contact to coordinate all mass notifications at NEOM sites. It is recommended that the adoption of a cellular phone solution is also adopted to allow mass notification to regular site users and registered visitors via a SMS message should there be reasons not to attend the site. This would need to be completed by the NEOM digital presence that each individual has, and it is therefore recognised should include all registered users, residents and digital nomads. A similar system using computer monitor active banners should also be considered for a similar notification purpose, and also so security and other messages, that are not of immediate importance, can be reinforced across site users. Dependent on the type and severity of emergency situation that emerges OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER(S)) should also consider, in consultation with NEOM, the use of local media such as television or radio broadcasting stations to promulgate mass notification messages if the incident covers a large area and requires the restriction of vehicles or people passing the area. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 11.8 Muster Points Muster points for users of the site must be established, and site users must be made aware of the relevant muster point to them. Again, this activity should be coordinated with the Site Fire Officer. The muster points and their use have the following requirements: • Provide sufficient space for the site occupancy levels. • Provide sufficient space away from potential sources of vulnerability or threat. • Security staff should be dispatched to muster points as quickly as possible and should complete a visual search of the muster point to ensure it is safe for use. • Be usable during both daylight and dark hours safely. • Consider the duration of use and protection from the environment as appropriate. Those mustering will have only brought essential items, so thought should be given to having basic items available, such as drinking water. • Cover both evacuation and invacuation scenarios. • Provide sufficient flexibility that site users can be directed to specific muster points if required. • Use of muster points should be exercised/practised at least annually. • Maps showing the muster points must be displayed in the guard posts and SCR as a minimum. • All staff and regular users of the site should be aware of their corresponding muster point. • Site visitors must be made aware of the muster point they should use and if relevant, who their guide will be. • The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for ensuring a muster system is in place that allows the quick and effective accounting for all personnel on the site. It is recommended that this is an automated check-in system wherever possible to expedite the process and allow responders to focus on critical issues. This system should be linked to the system in place for ensuring buildings are clear of personnel in an emergency. • As some incidents may be on-going and deny access to buildings or other locations, the selection of secondary holding areas should be planned. These must provide protection from the environment and provide basic needs like access to toilet facilities, food and water etc. • The muster point commander should provide information updates to those being held at the muster point to maintain order and prevent site users making their own decisions to move from the muster point. • Standard equipment needed by security staff, above and beyond, their standard equipment will be: o High Visibility Vests. o A loud hailer to enhance the ability to broadcast voice messages. o A first aid response pack. o Any muster point devices. These must be charged and ready to use at any time, including up to date data if the system requires it. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security 11.9 Incident Control Points Incident Control Points (ICPs) are vital to the effective command and control of an incident and the following points must be planned and briefed to all site responders, not just security staff: • ICPs – a network of these should be planned and be referenced by unambiguous naming. This will allow for the selection of the most appropriate ICPs for the incident. • Media Holding and Briefing Area – this must be a suitable location, preferably indoors where the media can be consolidated and briefed on mass as required. The location should be away from likely incident areas to avoid the incident unfolding in front of them. • Vehicle Holding Points – in any incident it is likely that numerous vehicles may arrive at the site. A large enough area of parking provision to hold the vehicles at should be identified. In that it must not constrain the movement of other vehicles along any ‘Red Routes’. The minimum requirements for each location are outlined below. 11.9.1 ICPs • Sited away from distractions. • Sufficient capacity for the number of people to be likely hosted. • Be sited as to not be bypassed to get to the incident area or have controlled access to the incident area. • Provide lighting, power and data as a minimum. If it is expected that the ICP may be used for some time, it should be sited in a safe building or covered external area with access to toilets, catering etc. • Provide an easily recognisable point, so it is easy for authorised people to find. • Provide sufficient planning and working space for all personal to perform their duties. • Have communications links to the locations that follow: o SCR. o Security Gatehouses. o Vehicle Holding Points. 11.9.2 Media Holding and Briefing Area • Sited at an easily accessible point of the site. • Adjacent to a parking area. • Positioned at a location unlikely to be affected by the incident directly. • Provide a covered or indoor location for briefing of the media. • In a location where the media can be controlled to not gain access further into the site.

Daily • Visual observation check of all camera views to ensure they are not degraded, dirty or require adjustment. • Check of any amendments made to the access control database, including privilege changes. • Run a report on failed entry attempts at access control points. • Run system diagnostic reports, taking appropriate action for any maintenance issues. Shift Changeover • A handover brief is conducted between all staff. • Check to ensure that relevant logs are accessible. • Check that emergency and contingency information is accessible. • Log any outstanding actions from the previous shift for action during the current shift. • Check all radios are charged or charging and set to the correct channel. • Complete a radio check with all standard radio users. • Ensure all planned occurrences during the shift are known, such as fire alarm tests etc. • Ensure all on-coming staff have attending a SIT, see Section 15.5. • Functionality check of all security systems is undertaken by the on-coming OPERATOR (NEOM, Proponent or Owner(s)). • Ensure at least one member of staff overlaps between main shift changes to provide continuity. Foster and Encourage • Foster an environment of checking and verifying as information received may be inaccurate and can be influenced by biases of interpretation and personal perception. • Establish open communications and good relationships within the control room, and Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security between the control room and the security officers on the ground to reduce barriers to reporting. • Encourage the team to understand human and technical limitations, and work together to ensure maximum coverage of eyes and ears on the ground. • Don’t rely on technology; for example, if logging technology does not enable all relevant information to be captured ensure that an alternative logging repository is available. 11.11 Duress Alarms All security staff and reception staff should be briefed on the location of any fixed duress alarms that have been installed as part of the base build program. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER should complete a review of the distribution of duress alarms around the site to ensure there are sufficient alarms points for how the site will be operated and the inherent risk that would require activation of a duress alarm. Where the distribution of duress alarms is not deemed correct for the site operations, the SECURITY SUPPLIER should provide mobile duress alarm devices either as part of the security communications equipment or as a separate device for its staff. Any duress alarms should be transmitted to the SCR for immediate follow-on investigation. 11.12 Building Security Security staff have a responsibility for general building security on the site unless this is responsibility of a specific building user.

The SECURITY SUPPLIER, through delegated responsibility from the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), is responsible for implementing the identity management and access credential policies to ensure that all users within the site have the appropriate level of access. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security All personnel ID cards shall be linked to biometric readers that positively links the individual to the ID information presented. It is the responsibility of the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to set out within the SMP what biometric information is required of personnel and to include this with the SSI. Systems should be integrated with the NEOM digital identification signature that is common across the region. This should reduce the burden upon the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) for the bulk issuing of credentials, dependent on the type of facility. The SECURITY SUPPLER is responsible for ensuring that the following processes are undertaken in setting up and managing the identity management system: • Develop an Identity Management Database that sets out the following information: o Full name. o Credential issue date. o Credential expiry date. o ID number. o Job title. o Passport / Iqama number. o Photograph. o User access level (What areas of the site, and when are the permitted access). o Site induction training in date (y/n). o Biometric data. • The SECURITY SUPPLIER should also ensure that a separate Visitor Identity Management database is established to record access onto and off the site. This should capture the following information: o Visitors full name. o Visitors sponsor / escort name for the visit. o Has authorisation been received for the visit (y/n). o Expected time and date of arrival. o Visitor access privileges. o Visitor site induction training. o Require multi-day pass (e.g. Contractor). • The security guard staff at the entrance into site shall ensure that all personnel and visitors possess the appropriate authorisation to enter the site. • Security staff should check that all personnel and visitors display ID pass at all times when within the NEOM site. • The Security Manager should plan a monthly audit to check and report on the following: o Incident reports (e.g. tailgating, reported breaches). o Revocation of access credentials. o Numbers of new credentials issued. o Numbers of credentials expired and follow-on confirmations. o Lost and stolen ID credentials. o Unused access credentials (flag non-use >3 weeks) by access zones. Enrolment For all new personnel working at the site or requiring regular access, an onboarding process will need to be instigated to enrol the individual. To initiate this process, the Security Manager or Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security authorised security staff member, should receive an authorisation to enrol request from an appropriate manager within the NEOM site. For the individual, they should supply the required information, biometric information and undergo a site enrolment prior to be granted an access credential. Termination For personnel who have left the organisation or no longer require access to the site, the SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible for removing the access credentials following notification from the Site Security Manager, as appropriate. This process should include recovering the individual’s credential and updating the identity management database of the user’s access rights. Visitors Further to the required information set out above, the SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible to ensure that the following is undertaken when a visitors arrives at site: • Request evidence of identification. • Ensure the visitor signs in the visitor's gate log. • Request the name of the person that the visitor wishes to visit. • Notify (by telephone/radio) the person that the visitor wishes to meet to determine if that person is available. • Check current visitor listing to determine if the visitor is permitted on the site without an escort. • Issue a visitor's pass. • If an unescorted visitor, direct the visitor to the appropriate area of the site. If the visitor is to be escorted, they must wait the security station until an escort arrives. 13.0 SITE ACCESS CONTROL – VEHICLES All vehicles accessing the NEOM sites will be required to be either authorised NEOM vehicles or subject to a security check.

This may alter only for official site vehicles that are used by multiple employees. • The vehicle permits and corresponding access database shall contain the following information: o Vehicle licence plate number. o Named driver(s). o Named driver(s) access credential pass details for site and photograph. o Vehicle permit number. o Issue date. o Expiry date. • For deliveries to site, security staff shall check the driver and contents against the manifest and pre-arrival information, which will contain the following minimum details: o Vehicle licence plate number Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o Driver name. o Expected ETA. o Delivery type and content details. o Site point of contact, contact details. • All deliveries onto site shall be recorded prior to arrival on a delivery scheduling system to assist the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) in coordinating and planning delivery timeslots. 13.1 Site Access for Vehicles The SECURITY SUPPLIER is responsible to the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) to ensure: • Security guards only allow authorised vehicles onto the site with a valid vehicle permit. • Vehicle permits are strictly controlled and only issued as necessary, and only for the duration needed. • In the event that an unauthorised vehicle arrives at site, the Guard Staff should investigate and reject the vehicle and not permit it entry onto site. • All deliveries are checked against the delivery schedule issued by the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER). • Vehicle access for visitors should be limited and they shall park either externally to the site if practicable or within a designated visitor parking area of the site. They can then either walk, be escorted or collected from the entry point. • If in doubt, then the security guard should deny access to the site and seek clarification. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) shall support this approach to maintain the security of the site. 14.0 PERSONNEL SECURITY The following considerations should be made for the employment of security personnel and other staff who will have access to sensitive information. • Background and employment checks for all security employees appropriate to their employment and access to information. To include: o Verification of prior employment. o Criminal record checks. o Driving licence checks if part of their employment duties. o Reference checks. • Provision of access rights to all staff must be approved by a line manager to confirm they require access to the area and confirmed by the Site Security Manager for specified areas. These would include server rooms, sensitive data storage rooms, certain private offices etc. It is expected that the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER), or site businesses/management company will complete appropriate vetting and background checks for other employees, residents and regular users. 15.0 TRAINING, AWARENESS AND EXERCISES The overarching training plan for security staff should have the following specific aims: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Ensuring all staff are adequately trained to complete their duties before the commencement of any shift. This also includes briefings to prepare them for known shift occurrences. • Provide continual professional development to improve the year on year service standards, site safety and site security standards. Audits conducted by NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) assess the trained standard of security staff.

NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC) reserve the right to request that any member of the security staff, who does not have adequate experience is replaced with another member of staff who does have the required experience. 16.0 SECURITY PERSONNEL – CODE OF CONDUCT It is vital that all security personnel conduct themselves to the highest possible standard in all their duties. It should be foremost that their role is to protect from harm or loss all users of the site they are assigned to. Security staff goals are to: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Provide a service that prevents site users sustaining injury. • Provide a service that helps prevent loss. • Provide an experience enhancing service to site users. This will be best achieved through a helpful, observant and proactive approach to their duties. • Acting as a site ambassador. The security personnel are likely to be the first impression of staff at a site, and therefore it is vital that this is a strong positive experience for the user. To help security staff achieve the above goals, an acceptable minimum code of conduct is mandatory. Non-compliance with the acceptable minimum code of conduct shall result in disciplinary action proportionate to the misdemeanour. 16.1 Acceptable Conduct All security personnel shall: • Conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner at all times. • To be firm, calm, and courteous in dealing with all people and enforcing the required security actions. The OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) is to ensure their staff are also compliant, courteous and respectful in their dealings with the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s staff, and that a one team approach is nurtured. • To be smartly dressed in the supplied uniform for the duration of their shift.

The SECURITY SUPPLIER shall ensure that all equipment is maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. Any unserviceable, damaged or lost equipment must be reported as soon as practicable to the relevant supervisor or manager, so that replacement equipment can be issued. It is not acceptable for a shift member to not have the serviceable standard equipment and therefore the shift supervisor must have access to spare items for immediate replacements. All security personnel should undertake familiarisation and safe use training on equipment. Where the equipment is only used periodically, or common mistakes dictate, refresher training should be provided. All security staff must wear the appropriate PPE for the task being undertaken. Tasks should be risk assessed by the SECURITY SUPPLIER and the relevant safety actions taken. Unsafe practices or the lack of an adequate safety risk assessment will not be tolerated. 16.4 Standard Information It is essential that each member of security staff carries a minimum ‘Reference Aide Memoire’ of vital information for the site they are employed upon. This should include the relevant security and emergency/incident management information referenced in this document and the SMP and SSI. However, the security staff are also on site to aid the efficient operation of the site. To help achieve this, it is required that security staff include in the aide memoire general site information. This information should consist of, but not be limited to: Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Maps/diagrams showing: o The site layout with any sensitive area information removed. o Parking areas. o Pedestrian movement routes to help explain how to reach certain locations. o Locations of facilities, such as toilets or first aid points. o Defibrillator unit locations. • Maps/diagrams should contain simple annotation in the common languages spoken by regular users of the site. As a minimum, this must be in Arabic and English. • The Public Relations/Media Enquiry contact telephone number. • Opening and closing times if applicable. • The prohibited item list in a pictogram form. • Emergency procedures and relevant information such as muster points etc. • Standard note book event recording formats of the information that will be required to be entered into the daily security log. • Blacklist or Watchlist details for individuals or vehicles. • Complaints forms to issue to site users if requested, and details of where these should be deposited. • Help desk telephone numbers. 16.5 Security Vehicles The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) should ensure that security vehicles comply with the following: • Wherever security personnel are present at a site, they will require access to a security vehicle. The number of vehicles should be scaled to the number of security personnel and the number of static tasks and mobile tasks. • Suitable for the terrain or movement corridors of the site. • Clearly marked as security vehicles on front, both sides and rear. Any lettering should be readable from a minimum distance of 20.0m. • Correctly registered, have proof of insurance and an up to date maintenance record. • Contain not less than half a tank of fuel at any point in time. • 4x4 SUV, 2018 or newer models. • Each vehicle should carry the following minimum equipment: o Comprehensive emergency first aid kit (x 1). o Emergency flashlight (x 1). o Fire extinguishers (x 2). o Fire Blanket (x 1), suitable for use on a person. o Jumper cable, for starting other vehicles (x 1). o Light bar (orange colour). o Recovery strap (x 1). o Sand shovel (x 1). o Small traffic cones (x 4). o A roll of warning tape, minimum 25.0m. o Traffic control wand (stop / go) – battery operated (x 2). o Vehicle mounted radio communications. o Vehicle tyre changing equipment and spare wheel.

SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security o 5 Litres of potable drinking water in sealed bottles for emergency use. • Contain breakdown and recovery contact cards. • Drivers should complete 1st Parade Vehicle Checks before using a vehicle daily. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is to prepare the 1st Parade Check List and ensure drivers are suitably trained and follow the requirements. An example 1st parade checklist is given below. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security All drivers must hold a valid KSA driving licence and be adequately covered by the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s insurance. Drivers should also be familiar with the vehicle they have been asked to drive and it is the SECURITY SUPPLIER’s responsibility to ensure safe driving practices are enforced for its staff. Security vehicles should never be used for personal use. On large sites where frequent trips are made by security staff, other than completing patrols, the use of well maintained, SECURITY SUPPLIER issued bicycles is acceptable. In these cases, the user must check the cycle prior to riding to ensure it is in good working order and they must be competent at riding the bicycle and obey the traffic rules for the site. 17.0 AUDITS Periodic audits will be completed of the security provided at each and every site. The audit will be conducted by a member of NEOM PUBLIC SAFETY - SECURITY / NEOC & NEOM EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (NEOC), and may be a pre-notified event or snap audit. The aim of the audit is to: • Assess the level of security being provided at a site. • Assess that the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER are providing the mandatory minimum standard of security for each site as agreed through the SMP and SSI. • Ensure the requirements of the contract for security are being met. • Assist the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER in being efficient in their provision of security at the site. Therefore, improving their service. The audit will be completed against standard templates to ensure consistency of assessment and that the correct requirements are being assessed. The SECURITY SUPPLIER is strongly encouraged to fully understand the SMP and SSI, and their requirements to ensure they are compliant at all times. The lead for any audit activity will be the Site Security Manager Audits may consider any requirement under Operational Site Security, and requirements stated in the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER)’s SMP or SECURITY SUPPLIER’s SSI. Audits are intended as opportunities to improve the services being provided and are conducted in conjunction with the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER. 18.0 COMMUNITY APPROACH TO SECURITY 18.1 User Communication Security should adopt the practice of regularly briefing regular site users, or the community, about security issues. This may include ‘text drops’ or ‘internet banners’ reinforcing the common security messages and making them aware of activities on the site as appropriate. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Whilst some messages reinforce the right behaviour on the site, the use of positive security marketing should also be used to allow controlled release of security information that will have a deterrent effect on any potential criminal activity. This may include statements around ‘regular non-pattern setting well-resourced patrols’, which provides reassurance to some members of the community, but sows the seed of doubt in the mind of potential criminals that they do not know when patrols will be happening, and that they are prepared to deal with situations properly. Education around things to do and not to do is also a strong way to reinforce the security message in the community and also tell the community what is acceptable and what is not acceptable behaviour. It is therefore expected that an element of the SMP should include for positive security marketing. 18.2 Attitude Attitude of all security personnel will support the ‘look and feel’ of the site for regular users, supply chain and visitors. In line with the code of conduct it is imperative that all security personnel support a friendly, welcoming and helpful approach to their tasks. All too often a ‘stand-offish’ or ‘rude ignoring’ attitude is adopted by security personnel, and this creates an unwelcoming environment. Security personnel should be encouraged to talk with site users and visitors, and this will have a positive effect on how the role of security is viewed on the site. Security personnel should be guided to understand their role is ensuring security and safety but this does not have to be applied in an aggressive or elusive manner. The ‘concierge’ of the site is a more appropriate attitude approach, that will then foster dialogue between site users and security personnel. 18.3 De-Escalation of Conflict / Aggression Community confidence in the security staff to be fair and impartial is vital. This is extremely true when dealing with situations of conflict or aggression. The approach to be adopted in all scenarios is to de-escalate the situation in a way that calms behaviour, not encourages violence. To achieve this all security staff should be briefed and trained in an appropriate Use of Force policy. The policy should default to the lowest level of force to resolve the situation. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security Force Level Intervention Description Lowest Using the physical presence of security staff at a Presence safe, but clearly visible distance, to disperse or disrupt aggressive behaviors. Direct verbal interaction with those involved in Verbal the scenario to calm tensions and seek a peaceful resolution to the situation.

Wherever possible, this option should not cause any injury. Requested Police support and allow the Police Police Highest to take primacy in the situation. In all cases the SCR must be informed prior to any intervention so they are able to monitor the situation and provide support as necessary. 19.0 EMERGENCY AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) is to ensure that a robust emergency and incident management structure is put in place on the site to deal with not only security events, but other events or incidents that could affect the site. These will be documented in the Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is a living document that all managers and supervisors should have read. All staff should be aware of their part in an event occurring, and the document should be periodically reviewed and amended where required. The ERP is owned by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and is their responsibility to brief, practice and resource adequately. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) as a minimum should appoint the following responsibilities: • Strategic, Tactical and Operational Commanders. • Emergency Command Centre Manager. • Information Technology. • Insurance Liaison. • Legal Advisor. • Facilities, Administration and Government Affairs. • Media Communications Representative. • Finance and Emergency Procurement Representative. • Health and Safety Representative. • Human Resources Representative. Rev No: 0. SEC-SCH-002 NEOM Operational Site Security of Uncontrolled once printed NEOM – Operational Site Security • Business Continuity Representative. Dependent on the size of the enterprise it may be that individual members of the Emergency Management Team will have to adopt dual roles. It should also be noted that not all of these roles will be required for all incidents, and therefore a first task is to decide what members of the team are required. 20.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) The procedures for dealing with emergencies that affect beyond the operational site will be detailed in the NEOM Emergency Response Plan. Both OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) and SECURITY SUPPLIER must be familiar with this document and its application. The OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) is responsible for drafting the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP will be a separate document to the SMP and SSI, as it will require wider distribution amongst staff members. All personnel must be briefed to the relevant level of detail for their role in responding to an event, incident or emergency on the site. The ERP will be reviewed by the OPERATOR (NEOM,PROPONENT OR OWNER) on the following occasions: • Twice yearly as a minimum. • Following audit comments being received from a NEOM department. • Following an incident, event or occurrence on site that required a response covered in the ERP. • Where the OPERATOR (NEOM, PROPONENT OR OWNER) believes there is an omission of a response plan due to changing site circumstances. A recommended minimum contents for the ERP are included at Appendix G.

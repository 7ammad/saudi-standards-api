Version 1.0 of Introduction 1.1 Introduction to the BCM Framework Considering the need of 24 x 7 availability of the business operations by financial institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, SAMA has developed a Business Continuity Management (BCM) framework for member organizations that would enhance the organizational resilience capability to ensure continuity and availability of their operations and services. The requirements are based on SAMA requirements, industry practices and international standards, such as ISO 22301, ISO 27001, Good practice guidelines from BCI, and Professional practice guidelines from DRII. All Member Organizations are required to comply with these requirements and integrate it formally in their BCM program. 1.2 Definitions  BCM is a holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an organization and the impacts to business operations those threats, if realized, might cause. It provides a framework for building organizational resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities.  BCM is part of the overall management system, which includes organizational structure, policies, planning activities, responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources that establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves business continuity.  IT Disaster recovery (IT DR) is part of BCM which includes policies, standards, procedures and processes pertaining to resilience, recovery or continuation of technology infrastructure supporting critical business processes.  Maximum Acceptable Outage (MAO) is defined as the time that would take for adverse impacts which might arise because of not providing a product/service or performing an activity, to become unacceptable.  Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is defined as the period following an incident within which, products or services must be resumed, activity must be resumed, or resources must be recovered.  Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is defined as the point to which, information used by an activity must be restored to enable the activity to operate on resumption. This can also be termed as “Maximum Data Loss”. 1.3 Scope The BCM framework document defines principles, objectives and control considerations for initiating, implementing, maintaining, monitoring and improving business continuity controls in member organizations. The BCM framework document is applicable to the full scope of the Member Organization, including subsidiaries, employees, subcontractors, third-parties and customers. The BCM framework document has an interrelationship with other corporate policies for related areas, such as enterprise risk management, health, safety and environment (HSE), physical security, cybersecurity (including cyber resilience and incident management). 1.4 Applicability The BCM Framework document is applicable to following: Version 1.0 of  All organizations affiliated with SAMA (“the Member Organizations”)  All banks operating in Saudi Arabia  All banking subsidiaries of Saudi banks  Subsidiaries of foreign banks situated in Saudi Arabia 1.5 Responsibilities SAMA mandates the BCM framework requirements document to Member Organizations. This document outlines the BCM requirements to be implemented by the Member Organizations. SAMA is the owner and is responsible for periodically updating the BCM Framework document. The Member Organizations are responsible for adopting and implementing the requirements stated in this framework document. 1.6 Interpretation SAMA, as the owner of the BCM framework requirements document, will provide interpretations of the principles, objectives and control considerations, if required. 1.7 Target Audience This document is intended for board of directors, CEOs, chief risk officer, senior and executive management, business owners, owners of information assets, CIOs, CISOs, business continuity managers, internal auditors and for those, who are responsible for and involved in defining, implementing and reviewing business continuity controls. 1.8 Review, Changes and Maintenance This document will be reviewed and maintained by SAMA. SAMA will review this document periodically to determine its effectiveness, including the effectiveness of the framework to address emerging business continuity threats and risks. If applicable, SAMA will update this document based on the outcome of the review. If a Member Organization considers that an update to this document is required, the Member Organization should formally submit the requested update to SAMA after obtaining approval from the business continuity manager and business continuity steering committee within the Member Organization. SAMA will review the requested update, and when approved, this document will be updated. Version control will be implemented for maintaining this document.
